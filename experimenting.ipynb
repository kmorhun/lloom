His advisors are urging him not to focus on his accomplishments and instead attack Trump, which is the only advice they can give, because he has no accomplishments. Of course, his whole strategy will be to try to get under Trump's skin, so he will repeat the word \"loser\" at every opportunity. I'll be watching the moderators, who hate Trump as much as Biden does, to see if they cut his mike if they don't like his answers.  \n",

It's the last 30 minutes. Not a prognostication, but a high statistical probability. For God's sake WHO agreed to have Joe stand up for 90 minutes? Which OF US could maintain clarity, focus, and tenor for said period? Soldiers start passing out on the parade field LONG before 90 minutes-----having nothing to do EXCEPT stand up. This was a ridiculous thing to agree to and it terrifies me come Nov that the fate of our democracy hinges on Joe executing high level prolonged intellectual chess under physical duress. 2000 years later and we're back at the coliseum. With hungry lions licking their chops at every real or perceived gaffe.  \n",
      "2  Previously I submitted a comment without editing it. Here is what I meant to say:\\n\\nI think anyone who has actually listened to Trump's weird tangents over the past few months and still somehow thinks he is going to do well is either not very intelligent or is in some partisan (or cultish) state of denial. \\n\\nPlus, he can't talk over Biden and therefore can't belittle or try to block out every words he says. He will actually have to wait until Biden is finished to respond, and I'm honestly not sure he can keep a clear thought in his head that long. \\n\\nBiden just needs to stay focused on the questions he is asked, and when responding to Trump, do so in a straightforward fashion, without groans or sarcastic remarks. Because simply doing the one thing Trump can't do--which is coming up with intelligent explanations of the issues, and ideas for solving problems that aren't drastic, draconian or simpleminded, puts him way ahead of Trump. \\n\\nAnd at least 55% of the American people are as yet not so disillusioned or cynical that they won't see the contrast.  \n",

      "\tPreviously I submitted a comment without editing it. Here is what I meant to say:  I think anyone who has actually listened to Trump's weird tangents over the past few months and still somehow thinks he is going to do well is either not very intelligent or is in some partisan (or cultish) state of denial.   Plus, he can't talk over Biden and therefore can't belittle or try to block out every words he says. He will actually have to wait until Biden is finished to respond, and I'm honestly not sure he can keep a clear thought in his head that long.   Biden just needs to stay focused on the questions he is asked, and when responding to Trump, do so in a straightforward fashion, without groans or sarcastic remarks. Because simply doing the one thing Trump can't do--which is coming up with intelligent explanations of the issues, and ideas for solving problems that aren't drastic, draconian or simpleminded, puts him way ahead of Trump.   And at least 55% of the American people are as yet not so disillusioned or cynical that they won't see the contrast.\n",
      "\t*No worries Biden will be all juiced up. CNN will share the questions ahead of time with Bidens handlers. Then they will practice all week and Biden.\n",
      "\t*This debate will be between Trump on one side and both Biden & CNN on the other side. I wish we have a 3rd party option.\n",
      "\t*I hope President Biden's debate prep includes exercises simulating what will happen when Trump ignores CNN's rules.  When, even though his mic is muted, he hectors the president in bizarre and irrational ways, as he physically intimidate Hillary in 2016.  President Biden must be prepared to shame him.  To talk to the camera, asking Trump supporters if they want an inarticulate, ill-informed hair-sprayed, fake-tanned bully to be a role model for their children. Don't hold back, President Biden.  Talk about Trump's tiny, porpoise flipper hands. His obesity.  His decades of business failure.  His weird Aqua-net hair.  The absence of his wife during his trial and during the debate. His son-in-law's $200 million dollar financing by the same Saudi oligarchs who attacked us on 911.  Don't hold back. Everything is at stake.\n",
      "\t*Me and my Unitarian Universalist church buddies are looking forward to the debate. Biden has boatloads of experience debating political opponents. The last debate Trump acted as usual as a child, endlessly grievance schtick, constantly interrupting Biden to the point Biden said right on the debate stage, “ This is so unpresidential.” Even if Biden flubs a few,  Biden is also pretty athletic physically, and in general people that are physically fit usually are on their game more than people that lay around the Oval Office, watching TV, eating McDonalds fast food.\n",

Face it to beat him in 20 took all the collusive power of a negative media to do it.  Trump already knows he can take the high ground and just let Biden keep talking. Remember also that in Sept there is Hunters ( really Biden family) tax evasion trial.  That could be a nightmare for Joe.\n",

It’s always someone else fault…sounds too much like the dictator of Russia to me. American veterans deserve more than the stab in the back that the Republican Russia First policy will bring.\n",

It's that your suggestion that the Biden campaign talk this way not only won't work, it will hurt their cause. Every on-the-street interview of voters in other than wealthy metro suburbs, including here in the New York Times, shows that they have totally turned off to this blather and being told not to believe their lying eyes.  To take the easy lay-ups, the idea that anyone would think the inflation situation was better under Biden than Trump is chair-rollingly funny. And the implication that the world situation was more stable under Biden than Trump is just plain blind. I have a bunch of problems with Trump but he was absolutely correct that the allies were not living up to their defense spending obligations.  I know what you're doing with the pandemic statistics and its cheap relation to employment numbers, but now that so many people's main concern is what our RESPONSE to the pandemic did to society and our kids, it also won't play. But I thank you for tonight's dose of comedy.  See ya.\n",
      "\t*@David My analysis is based on Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Fed. Your \"man on the street\" analysis is the comedy. Inflation peaked in June 22 at 9.1% due to supply chain problems associated with the pandemic. Today inflation is 3.3% and falling. Biden deals with problems. Trump denies them, blames others for them and then just makes stuff up. Trump is not interested in governing America. Trump wants the White House so he can pardon himself and wreak retribution on his enemies. Simply stated, I prefer the rule of law over the law of rulers. Vote for Trump and rule of law is out the door.\n",
      "\t*Face it - America doesn't want either of these guys. But the media shills stick with Biden. If they didn't perhaps the Democrats might have looked elsewhere, but now they are too entangled together to admit the truth. Get over your egos and politics and help America by telling the truth. Both are decrepit.\n",
      "\t*President Biden has run the country competently for three years, and yet all the focus is on this foolish fear that the media generates:  one slip by Biden and he's \"lost\" the election.  Why isn't felon trump under the spotlight instead?  He has no policies, he rants like a madman, lies like humans breath, and will break all the debate rules within the first two minutes.  Why isn't the media telling Americans to watch for these things, and declaring that a ranting, lying madman is surely not someone to elect as our president?  Why does trump get to be \"trump\" without any consequences, especially since he is an existential threat to our democracy and our country.\n",
      "\t*My anxiety is simply based on the fact that virtually every republican will forgive absolutely anything trump may do or say no matter how horribly he comes off.  Trump may just deny he participated in the debate and it was really a lookalike funded by the evil Democrats and CNN, who shouldn’t be trusted.    On the other hand any slight waver from Biden will have a lot of Democrats throwing their hands up in despair. A bad showing by trump will be denied, not followed up on, and immediately buried by something even worse that trump will orchestrate by Friday.  Meanwhile, the (especially) right, center and left leaning news outlets will focus on and replay any sign of  a Biden misstep for weeks.\n",

      "\tPreviously I submitted a comment without editing it. Here is what I meant to say:  I think anyone who has actually listened to Trump's weird tangents over the past few months and still somehow thinks he is going to do well is either not very intelligent or is in some partisan (or cultish) state of denial.   Plus, he can't talk over Biden and therefore can't belittle or try to block out every words he says. He will actually have to wait until Biden is finished to respond, and I'm honestly not sure he can keep a clear thought in his head that long.   Biden just needs to stay focused on the questions he is asked, and when responding to Trump, do so in a straightforward fashion, without groans or sarcastic remarks. Because simply doing the one thing Trump can't do--which is coming up with intelligent explanations of the issues, and ideas for solving problems that aren't drastic, draconian or simpleminded, puts him way ahead of Trump.   And at least 55% of the American people are as yet not so disillusioned or cynical that they won't see the contrast.\n",
      "\t*I’m not sure why Biden gets such high marks for his SOTU speech. He was reading from a teleprompter, not answering questions or having Trump repeatedly try to bully him. The debate will be a much different situation. Both men are well past the prime of their lives.Neither should be up for office. Any younger, fairly aggressive GOP candidate would handily beat Biden. Any younger, smooth, responsible Dem candidate could easily defeat Trump. The fact that the race is between these two, no matter how they perform Thursday, only showcases the continuing decline of our country.\n",

Forget about \"May the best man win.\"  It's the one who is the best (In this case the least worst.) debater or the candidate with the snappiest TV ad.  There's gotta be a better way, or maybe just have better candidates.\n",
      "\t*a \"presidential looking\" debate would require two candidates BOTH chosen in primaries in a DEMOCRATIC fashion. Instead we have one coronated by special interests and another propped up by theocrats and the uneducated and those who are easily confused by a fraudulent liar. pretty SAD. Next time have DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES and select real candidates who represent our CITIZENS.\n",
      "\t*Face it - America doesn't want either of these guys. But the media shills stick with Biden. If they didn't perhaps the Democrats might have looked elsewhere, but now they are too entangled together to admit the truth. Get over your egos and politics and help America by telling the truth.

      "\t*I believe Biden will do well enough to call it a win - Biden is always underestimated and he tends to rise to the occasion when his credibility, fitness and energy are questioned.     As for Trump, I actually think that the rules are going to work against his style, but will actually work in his favor as it will temper his ability to interrupt, be impulsive and showcase his inability to manage himself.    That is what I want the people to see - an angry, undisciplined and unhinged mess that does not belong within 10,000 miles of the oval office and nuclear codes.   The best outcome is that the people see exactly what they will get for their vote.   If they do, I trust the American people to do the right thing.\n",

Trump, and any Republican running this year, has nothing to run on. He/they have done nothing and have no plans to do anything.   If Biden tries to go the policy route, Trump will eat his lunch. America doesn’t want to hear a policy debate. I don’t want to hear about policy, I want him to spend the entire evening systematically taking Trump apart using Trump’s own stupid words.   Enough of “Democrat Nice”. America is at war. The war has been going on for 30 years and democrats have been trying to ignore the conflict and govern the country.

      "\tBiden will do what he did last time in the primaries: stall for time to run out the clock by repeating filler phrases -- no, I really mean that -- it's not just hyperbole -- because he has nothing to say. His advisors are urging him not to focus on his accomplishments and instead attack Trump, which is the only advice they can give, because he has no accomplishments. Of course, his whole strategy will be to try to get under Trump's skin, so he will repeat the word \"loser\" at every opportunity. I'll be watching the moderators, who hate Trump as much as Biden does, to see if they cut his mike if they don't like his answers.\n",
      "\t*Previously I submitted a comment without editing it. Here is what I meant to say:  I think anyone who has actually listened to Trump's weird tangents over the past few months and still somehow thinks he is going to do well is either not very intelligent or is in some partisan (or cultish) state of denial.   Plus, he can't talk over Biden and therefore can't belittle or try to block out every words he says. He will actually have to wait until Biden is finished to respond, and I'm honestly not sure he can keep a clear thought in his head that long.   Biden just needs to stay focused on the questions he is asked, and when responding to Trump, do so in a straightforward fashion, without groans or sarcastic remarks. Because simply doing the one thing Trump can't do--which is coming up with intelligent explanations of the issues, and ideas for solving problems that aren't drastic, draconian or simpleminded, puts him way ahead of Trump.   And at least 55% of the American people are as yet not so disillusioned or cynical that they won't see the contrast.\n",
      "\t*For anyone who has been watching these two men recently should realize that President Biden is older but also wiser, might speak slowly and softly at times but is quick and sharp. He is experienced, competent, intelligent, accomplished and savvy -- most of all he is honorable and committed to preserving our republic as it currently stands. And he has been known to give a barn burner of a speech and deliver a killer SOTU address.  On the other hand, his opponent, former, let's keep it that way, President Trump is -- well if you have eyes and ears, you know.\n",

Inflation peaked in June 22 at 9.1% due to supply chain problems associated with the pandemic. Today inflation is 3.3% and falling. Biden deals with problems. Trump denies them, blames others for them and then just makes stuff up. Trump is not interested in governing America. Trump wants the White House so he can pardon himself and wreak retribution on his enemies. Simply stated, I prefer the rule of law over the law of rulers. Vote for Trump and rule of law is out the door.\n",

As for Trump, I actually think that the rules are going to work against his style, but will actually work in his favor as it will temper his ability to interrupt, be impulsive and showcase his inability to manage himself.    That is what I want the people to see - an angry, undisciplined and unhinged mess that does not belong within 10,000 miles of the oval office and nuclear codes.   The best outcome is that the people see exactly what they will get for their vote.   If they do, I trust the American people to do the right thing.\n",
      "\t*Trump is in an environment he can't control. He has no grasp of policy issues. He has no credible policies to offer Americans beyond slogans. He has no audience of supporters to play to for encouragement. His mic will be silenced when not asked to speak. Biden will tout his achievements which are considerable (lowest unemployment in decades, manufacturing jobs at an all time high, the best post Covid economy in the world, prescription drug prices drastically reduced etc.,). Biden will also may hay of Trump's 34 felony convictions involving an adult film actress, while his wife was pregnant, as well as a being convicted of liability for sexual assault by a jury. It will be a tough night for Trump against a savvy pro.\n",

Biden has brought America back with record job growth, economic growth that is leading the world, lowering inflation and ending the pandemic. Joe has restored our foreign alliances. The only way that Trump can claim to have done better is to lie. And he will.  My humble suggestion is for Joe to respond to every Trump lie by directing viewers to his TrumpLies.com website where a legion of fact checkers can tell America the truth. That way, Joe can talk about what he wants to accomplish in the next four years while Trump talks about who he wants to throw in prison.\n",
