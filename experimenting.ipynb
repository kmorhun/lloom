His advisors are urging him not to focus on his accomplishments and instead attack Trump, which is the only advice they can give, because he has no accomplishments. Of course, his whole strategy will be to try to get under Trump's skin, so he will repeat the word \"loser\" at every opportunity. I'll be watching the moderators, who hate Trump as much as Biden does, to see if they cut his mike if they don't like his answers.  \n",

Which OF US could maintain clarity, focus, and tenor for said period? Soldiers start passing out on the parade field LONG before 90 minutes-----having nothing to do EXCEPT stand up. This was a ridiculous thing to agree to and it terrifies me come Nov that the fate of our democracy hinges on Joe executing high level prolonged intellectual chess under physical duress. 2000 years later and we're back at the coliseum. With hungry lions licking their chops at every real or perceived gaffe.  \n",
      "2  Previously I submitted a comment without editing it. Here is what I meant to say:\\n\\nI think anyone who has actually listened to Trump's weird tangents over the past few months and still somehow thinks he is going to do well is either not very intelligent or is in some partisan (or cultish) state of denial. \\n\\nPlus, he can't talk over Biden and therefore can't belittle or try to block out every words he says. He will actually have to wait until Biden is finished to respond, and I'm honestly not sure he can keep a clear thought in his head that long. \\n\\nBiden just needs to stay focused on the questions he is asked, and when responding to Trump, do so in a straightforward fashion, without groans or sarcastic remarks. Because simply doing the one thing Trump can't do--which is coming up with intelligent explanations of the issues, and ideas for solving problems that aren't drastic, draconian or simpleminded, puts him way ahead of Trump. \\n\\nAnd at least 55% of the American people are as yet not so disillusioned or cynical that they won't see the contrast.  \n",

      "\tBiden will do what he did last time in the primaries: stall for time to run out the clock by repeating filler phrases -- no, I really mean that -- it's not just hyperbole -- because he has nothing to say. His advisors are urging him not to focus on his accomplishments and instead attack Trump, which is the only advice they can give, because he has no accomplishments. Of course, his whole strategy will be to try to get under Trump's skin, so he will repeat the word \"loser\" at every opportunity. I'll be watching the moderators, who hate Trump as much as Biden does, to see if they cut his mike if they don't like his answers.\n",
      "\t*Do you think anyone will really talk about how a 30 year old in this country can’t find a house or apartment that won’t bankrupt them? We need a federal housing construction plan to build 20 million $150,000 homes at 3 percent interest for first time buyers\n",
      "\t*Whenever I see coverage of Trump rallies or any coverage of his base, I’m reminded of a line from “To Sir With Love” where the Sidney Poitier character says to his class:  “It seems you know so little, and are so easily amused, I can look forward to a very happy time.”\n",
      "\t*Trump only has to ask Biden a question he hasn’t rehearsed a hundred times, such as the multiplication tables for the number 9.  That would likely be game over for Joe\n",
      "\t*Biden saved me financially when he was my Senator when a surgery left me disabled and the SS doctor assigned to examine me never even glanced at my 4 inch medical file. All he did was look at my hands and turned me down. He was in a makeshift office with cardboard boxes strewn about.  I was devastated. I called Biden's office to explain what happened and gave the doctor's name. Two weeks later the office called and my disability went through.  I have faith in the man who helped me on the last call I made when I got nowhere with everyone else. I'm as grateful today as I was then. He'll be fine.\n",
      "\t*“Neither will look Presidential.”  I’m sorry, but this is ridiculous and insanity.  Biden is Presidential.  Biden is light years better than Trump, and anyone insisting these two men are the same in awfulness has allowed themselves to be caught up in the desperate attempt by the media to paint this election as a totally normal one between two totally normal candidates “that no one likes.”  I’m old enough to remember the 2016 Presidential debates, when the sexist media decided that Hillary Clinton “was too prepared.”    I’m old enough to remember when Joe Biden was liked by just about everyone.   The only thing that has changed is the Republican smear campaign, and the media that has gone right along with them.\n",
      "\t*No minds will be changed by this debate.\n",
      "\t*President Joe Biden is simply a better human being and leader. He has done a very good job for America.  Donnie is all bluster, lies, bravado, bankruptcy and is a pathetic excuse for a human being.  The GOP needs go away from idol worship and to return to something that is not fixated on bigotry and free money.  Trumpism is not conservatism’s.\n",
      "\t*I’m an 80-year-old registered Independent whose political memories go all the way back to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. I liked Ike.  CNN’s panel of debate reporters must question Mr. Trump about January 6, 2021.  I watched live TV news reports all day on January 6. I saw for myself what happened at our U.S. Capitol on that day. What Mr. Trump caused to happen sickened me. For as long as I live, I will never forget it.  President Joe Biden is a decent, wise, and god-fearing man with character who is good for America. Regardless of what happens during the debate, I’m standing by him. He has my vote.\n",
      "\t*I have to say, the constant fearfulness of many Democrats about Biden is just not going to help him as he goes into one of the defining battles of his life. A little cheering is more likely to boost self-confidence, and Biden has plenty to be confident about -- including a pull-no-punches verbal style.\n",
      "\t*I am amazed there is this much emphasis on the debate. Joe will have plenty of rest, will have rehearsed key points ad nauseam, and will stick to the script written for him. The other 364 days are what really showcase his abilities -- that of an elderly man who mumbles his way through speaking, walking, etc. It's painful to watch and will only get worse.\n",
      "\t*I’m not sure why Biden gets such high marks for his SOTU speech. He was reading from a teleprompter, not answering questions or having Trump repeatedly try to bully him. The debate will be a much different situation. Both men are well past the prime of their lives.Neither should be up for office. Any younger, fairly aggressive GOP candidate would handily beat Biden. Any younger, smooth, responsible Dem candidate could easily defeat Trump. The fact that the race is between these two, no matter how they perform Thursday, only showcases the continuing decline of our country.\n",
      "\t*Best-case scenario: Biden delivers a strong, commanding performance that knocks Trump back on his heels, eases Democrats' doubts about his age and finally gives him the substantial and durable polling boost he needs that has thus far eluded him.  Second-best scenario: Biden has a severe, McConnell-like \"senior moment\" or commits a monumental gaffe that compels him to end his campaign and make way for a younger, more energetic and electable Democratic nominee like Gretchen Whitmer who can put the race firmly out of Trump's reach.  Worst but most likely scenario: Biden slogs through with a non-disastrous but typically stilted and listless performance that leaves the race essentially unchanged. (As for Trump, I'm assuming that as usual, nothing he says or does will affect his support one way or the other.)\n",
      "\t*One candidate belongs in prison; the other belongs in an assisted living facility.  Neither belongs on a presidential debate stage.  That said, the choice is clear.  Assisted living, all the way.\n",
      "\t*No worries Biden will be all juiced up. CNN will share the questions ahead of time with Bidens handlers. Then they will practice all week and Biden.\n",
      "\t*I love that Karen Finney, a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign has a big, useful opinion.\n",
      "\t*Calm down.  Trump has long since jumped the shark.\n",
      "\t*It's not going to make any difference at all.\n",
      "\t*Life under Trump was utterly terrifying and exhaustingly stressful.\n",
      "\t*Someone please tell him not to use the phrase \"come on man\" when talking. It makes him sound old and completely out of step.\n",
      "\t*This debate will be between Trump on one side and both Biden & CNN on the other side. I wish we have a 3rd party option.\n",
      "\t*I will watch posts from after the debate; I see no reason to become anxious over something I have no control over.  Biden is the person I am voting for--no doubt at all in my mind.\n",
      "\t*@Nostra Thomas He could have compared Taylor Swift to Ivanka.\n",
      "\t*The smart kid who studies usually beats the dumb kid who doesn’t or waits until the last moment to do so - usually.  President Biden will clean Trump’s clock.\n",
      "\t*The Democrats were foolish to allow an old, unpopular Biden to run for reelection. The majority of Americans don’t view Trump as a threat to democracy and don’t care what happened on January 6, 2021. They care about the border, the economy, gas prices, inflation, the price of groceries, and 7% mortgage rates. Trump will flip the swing states as he did in 2016 and defeat Biden in November.  Trump is a nut but he will get the economy back on track and secure the border.\n",
      "\t*@Jack D of course, your majority speaks for 77 million, but our majority speaks for 89 million, who do not buy any of the things you listed, but remember Trump’s four years of lunacy and the death of more than 1 million people from COVID (highest in the world) and the greatest economic disaster. You couldn’t buy toilet paper in the store for months. Sell your good elsewhere, Mister D.\n",
      "\t*@Jack D  God forbid!  Millions of Americans care deeply about women's reproductive rights being lost under Trump;  millions of Americans do care about Trump's willingness to destroy democracy;  millions of Americans don't want a convicted felon who is a pathological liar as President.  Not to mention, he has NO plan for reducing inflation, lowering gas prices and bringing down interest rates.  His only plan is to give tax cuts (again) to the wealthiest Americans.  Talk about a drag on the economy, not to mention the deleterious effect it will have on the deficit.  I'll take Joe any day of the week--next to Trump.  Any sane America would do the same.\n",
      "\t*I agree with Francis Malone,  I hope we see the strongest Biden ever.  It is the only way to defeat the felon.\n",
      "\t*All Trump has to do is return attention to Biden's disastrous handling of the border and the rise of pro-Palestinian extremism in the US. Those are motivating issues for many Americans.\n",
      "\t*@Dan Disastrous because of Trump telling his Republican cronies in Congress to kill the bill that could have fixed immigration.\n",
      "\t*I hope Joe’s focus isn’t just placed on Trump, but on the entire Republican Party.  He just needs to keep in the back of his mind that these are the people who just put his son through the legal ringer, all in retaliation.    That should keep him laser focused.  Focusing solely on Trump, well that just an invitation into insanity.\n",
      "\t*I think anyone who has actually listened to Trump's weird tangents over the past few months and still somehow thinks he is going to do well is either just not very unintelligent or in some partisan (or cultish) state of denial.  Plus, he can't talk over Biden and therefore can't belittle or try to block out every words he says. He will actually have to wait until Biden is finished to respond, and I'm honestly not sure he keep a clear thought in his head that long.  Biden just needs to stay focused on the questions he is asked, and when responding to Trump, do so in a straightforward fashion, with no groans or sarcastic remarks. Because simply doing the one thing Trump can't do--which is coming up with intelligent explanations of the issues and ideas for solving problems that aren't drastic, draconian or simpleminded, puts him way ahead of Trump.   And at least 55% of the American people are as yet not deluded, disillusioned, or cynical enough that they will miss the contrast.\n",

Face it to beat him in 20 took all the collusive power of a negative media to do it.  Trump already knows he can take the high ground and just let Biden keep talking.

Biden has brought America back with record job growth, economic growth that is leading the world, lowering inflation and ending the pandemic. Joe has restored our foreign alliances. The only way that Trump can claim to have done better is to lie. And he will.  My humble suggestion is for Joe to respond to every Trump lie by directing viewers to his TrumpLies.com website where a legion of fact checkers can tell America the truth. That way, Joe can talk about what he wants to accomplish in the next four years while Trump talks about who he wants to throw in prison.\n",

Inflation peaked in June 22 at 9.1% due to supply chain problems associated with the pandemic. Today inflation is 3.3% and falling. Biden deals with problems. Trump denies them, blames others for them and then just makes stuff up. Trump is not interested in governing America.

The debates are just something the networks have figured out draw eyeballs and advertisers. I suspect candidates just do them as part of electioneering dogma. Good riddance!\n",

To talk to the camera, asking Trump supporters if they want an inarticulate, ill-informed hair-sprayed, fake-tanned bully to be a role model for their children. Don't hold back, President Biden.  Talk about Trump's tiny, porpoise flipper hands. His obesity.  His decades of business failure.  His weird Aqua-net hair.  The absence of his wife during his trial and during the debate. His son-in-law's $200 million dollar financing by the same Saudi oligarchs who attacked us on 911.  Don't hold back. Everything is at stake.\n",
      "\t*@Tall Tree Expecting Imminent Cutting  I don’t think Trump will go through with this debate.    There’s nothing in it for him; no crowd to perform for, no cheers or applause from his followers, no ability to talk over Biden or the moderator due to muted mikes, and no pandering pep-talks from his staff during breaks.  Trump doesn’t do anything unless it benefits him or hurts someone else.  The debate format won’t give him the reactions he craves when he spews his mad-hatter hatred.\n",
      "\t*I hope that Biden freezes up, slurs his words, takes a bad fall, and that Trump looks totally stronger and more in charge.  Hopefully only then will the Democratic Party come to its senses and replace Biden with another candidate who has a chance of winning.  Biden has none.\n",
      "\t*@Arnold Alas, Democrats from average everyday people who post on newspaper comment threads all the way up to top party operatives continue to live in denial.  They deny or dismiss all these polls, one after another, that show President Biden trailing.  They tell us that Biden has the body and mind of a 50-year old, and about how sharp and attuned he is in private meetings (though off the record they tell the Wall Street Journal otherwise).   And, perhaps worse, they viciously attack anyone from the D side who has been sounding the alarm . . . it's like getting angry at someone for waking you up to tell you your house is on fire.\n",

It accounts for why so many people are dreading this debate. I have zero doubts that Biden will prove everyone wrong and easily win this debate. It is Trump whose supporters need to be worried. I will be watching eyes wide open.\n",
      "\t*Face it - America doesn't want either of these guys. But the media shills stick with Biden.

Why isn't felon trump under the spotlight instead?  He has no policies, he rants like a madman, lies like humans breath, and will break all the debate rules within the first two minutes.  Why isn't the media telling Americans to watch for these things, and declaring that a ranting, lying madman is surely not someone to elect as our president?  Why does trump get to be \"trump\" without any consequences, especially since he is an existential threat to our democracy and our country.\n",
      "\t*Biden has enough material to do a 45 minute, uninterrupted, stand up routine. From, “injecting bleach grab em’ by, suckers and losers, I like those who weren’t shot down, the greatest health care plan, nobody is tougher on Russia, I am responsible for overturning Roe”, and on and on.  Trump, and any Republican running this year, has nothing to run on. He/they have done nothing and have no plans to do anything.   If Biden tries to go the policy route, Trump will eat his lunch. America doesn’t want to hear a policy debate. I don’t want to hear about policy, I want him to spend the entire evening systematically taking Trump apart using Trump’s own stupid words.   Enough of “Democrat Nice”. America is at war. The war has been going on for 30 years and democrats have been trying to ignore the conflict and govern the country.  Thursday night is a major tipping point for the election and, by extension, America. Biden must win decisively. And he must do it by attacking Trump at every opportunity.\n",
      "\t*I really don't know why Democrats are so concerned. DJT will be his typical school boy self. He can't control himself for the suration. There will be ots of name calling, insults and unpresidential behavior, which is not the way to win those on the fence. Biden simply needs to act presidntial and does not have to seem like the smartest guy in the room. It will be a mistake if he chides Trump about ths NY conviction, which is disrespected by many moderates.  I'm a Republican, and I'm worried. Unless Biden makes horrible goofs or descends to the low insult level, he will at least tie and probably win.\n",
      "\t*C'mon people, have a little optimism.    Joe is going to do just like he did at the State of the Union.  He won't take any bait, he'll stay on message, he'll make perfectly underhanded yet not disrespectful retorts, he'll get all the subtle and not-so-subtle digs in at Trump, and come out looking like a hero.  Watch the poll number climb afterwards.  Former will look like such a complete doofus he'll probably try to skate on the second debate.\n",

You recall how agonizing it is to change from savings-and-standard time and back, even for the youngest and strongest; how it should end because one just cannot function after the disruption of one hour's sleep.  What I want to hear are explanations of how President Biden manages to change time zones, hours of difference, and appear lucid as -- as he is -- time after time, trip after trip? It takes a lot of travelers one or more days of a reduced schedule to overcome jet lag; yet Joe shows up right there in hours, greeting the world's most important leaders. There had better not be a peep from any of the time-change whiners that predictably show up twice a year all over the U.S.  And they should NEVER run for president.\n",

As for Trump, I actually think that the rules are going to work against his style, but will actually work in his favor as it will temper his ability to interrupt, be impulsive and showcase his inability to manage himself.    That is what I want the people to see - an angry, undisciplined and unhinged mess that does not belong within 10,000 miles of the oval office and nuclear codes.   The best outcome is that the people see exactly what they will get for their vote.   If they do, I trust the American people to do the right thing.\n",

Here is what I meant to say:  I think anyone who has actually listened to Trump's weird tangents over the past few months and still somehow thinks he is going to do well is either not very intelligent or is in some partisan (or cultish) state of denial.   Plus, he can't talk over Biden and therefore can't belittle or try to block out every words he says. He will actually have to wait until Biden is finished to respond, and I'm honestly not sure he can keep a clear thought in his head that long.   Biden just needs to stay focused on the questions he is asked, and when responding to Trump, do so in a straightforward fashion, without groans or sarcastic remarks. Because simply doing the one thing Trump can't do--which is coming up with intelligent explanations of the issues, and ideas for solving problems that aren't drastic, draconian or simpleminded, puts him way ahead of Trump.   And at least 55% of the American people are as yet not so disillusioned or cynical that they won't see the contrast.\n",

There's gotta be a better way, or maybe just have better candidates.\n",

      "\tThe Democrats were foolish to allow an old, unpopular Biden to run for reelection. The majority of Americans don’t view Trump as a threat to democracy and don’t care what happened on January 6, 2021. They care about the border, the economy, gas prices, inflation, the price of groceries, and 7% mortgage rates. Trump will flip the swing states as he did in 2016 and defeat Biden in November.  Trump is a nut but he will get the economy back on track and secure the border.\n",

There will be no repeat of Jan 6, 2021 insurrection at our Capital building, because they don’t want to go to jail, like the  previous insurrectionists, Justice said over a 1000 have been prosecuted, maybe 500 or so go to jail, Justice also said they expect to charge a 1000 more\n",

From, “injecting bleach grab em’ by, suckers and losers, I like those who weren’t shot down, the greatest health care plan, nobody is tougher on Russia, I am responsible for overturning Roe”, and on and on.  Trump, and any Republican running this year, has nothing to run on. He/they have done nothing and have no plans to do anything.   If Biden tries to go the policy route, Trump will eat his lunch. America doesn’t want to hear a policy debate. I don’t want to hear about policy, I want him to spend the entire evening systematically taking Trump apart using Trump’s own stupid words.   Enough of “Democrat Nice”. America is at war. The war has been going on for 30 years and democrats have been trying to ignore the conflict and govern the country.  Thursday night is a major tipping point for the election and, by extension, America. Biden must win decisively. And he must do it by attacking Trump at every opportunity.\n",

His advisors are urging him not to focus on his accomplishments and instead attack Trump, which is the only advice they can give, because he has no accomplishments. Of course, his whole strategy will be to try to get under Trump's skin, so he will repeat the word \"loser\" at every opportunity.

Face it to beat him in 20 took all the collusive power of a negative media to do it.  Trump already knows he can take the high ground and just let Biden keep talking.

Biden is light years better than Trump, and anyone insisting these two men are the same in awfulness has allowed themselves to be caught up in the desperate attempt by the media to paint this election as a totally normal one between two totally normal candidates “that no one likes.”  I’m old enough to remember the 2016 Presidential debates, when the sexist media decided that Hillary Clinton “was too prepared.”    I’m old enough to remember when Joe Biden was liked by just about everyone.

What I want to hear are explanations of how President Biden manages to change time zones, hours of difference, and appear lucid as -- as he is -- time after time, trip after trip? It takes a lot of travelers one or more days of a reduced schedule to overcome jet lag; yet Joe shows up right there in hours, greeting the world's most important leaders.

      "\t*@Jack D Trump will get the economy back on track, really, enlighten me?  Trump will order his Treasury secretary to tank lower interest rates aggressively which will work for about a year until massive inflation kicks back into gear.  In the long run, the rich will double down hard on \"free money\" and will be ready to swoop on with cash when, despite lower interest rates, inflation wipes out any advantage to the poor and middle class.  And all those MAGA supporters will continue to support him even though he just did to them what he did to Stormy Daniels.\n",
      "\t*@David My analysis is based on Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Fed. Your \"man on the street\" analysis is the comedy. Inflation peaked in June 22 at 9.1% due to supply chain problems associated with the pandemic. Today inflation is 3.3% and falling. Biden deals with problems. Trump denies them, blames others for them and then just makes stuff up. Trump is not interested in governing America. Trump wants the White House so he can pardon himself and wreak retribution on his enemies. Simply stated, I prefer the rule of law over the law of rulers. Vote for Trump and rule of law is out the door.\n",

      "\tI once heard a pundit describe Joe Biden answering a question as \"like watching a small plane trying to land in a strong wind\".  You know it will eventually get to the ground -- but in one piece?  That's our fear.  Trump's demeanor is less material to the election.  He could talk sharks and batteries all night and his fans would love it.\n",
      "\t*Is it possible that people are so worried about Biden is because they know he is out of it. Hope he implodes and can be replaced at the convention\n",
      "\t*Mr. Trump has an advantage in any debate because Mr. Biden's answers will be, to some extent, related to facts.\n",
