His advisors are urging him not to focus on his accomplishments and instead attack Trump, which is the only advice they can give, because he has no accomplishments. Of course, his whole strategy will be to try to get under Trump's skin, so he will repeat the word \"loser\" at every opportunity. I'll be watching the moderators, who hate Trump as much as Biden does, to see if they cut his mike if they don't like his answers.  \n",

This was a ridiculous thing to agree to and it terrifies me come Nov that the fate of our democracy hinges on Joe executing high level prolonged intellectual chess under physical duress. 2000 years later and we're back at the coliseum.

      "2  Previously I submitted a comment without editing it. Here is what I meant to say:\\n\\nI think anyone who has actually listened to Trump's weird tangents over the past few months and still somehow thinks he is going to do well is either not very intelligent or is in some partisan (or cultish) state of denial. \\n\\nPlus, he can't talk over Biden and therefore can't belittle or try to block out every words he says. He will actually have to wait until Biden is finished to respond, and I'm honestly not sure he can keep a clear thought in his head that long. \\n\\nBiden just needs to stay focused on the questions he is asked, and when responding to Trump, do so in a straightforward fashion, without groans or sarcastic remarks. Because simply doing the one thing Trump can't do--which is coming up with intelligent explanations of the issues, and ideas for solving problems that aren't drastic, draconian or simpleminded, puts him way ahead of Trump. \\n\\nAnd at least 55% of the American people are as yet not so disillusioned or cynical that they won't see the contrast.  \n",

It’s Trump’s backers who ought to be worried. I thought Trump would avoid debating, as it will expose voters to a real-time, unvarnished view of what the candidate is like now — incoherent, irrational, unhinged, to a greater extent than even a few months ago.', 'The press is irresponsible and fueling a failure. President Biden will be fine.', 'Good news. If true that Assange helped Trump get elected, Trump certainly did not go out of his way to help him. Why is this issue resolved in an election year when Biden is not doing so well? Is this an attempt to salvage the Librrtarian vote?', 'I think Biden will be okay. He has been practicing his lines for quite a number of weeks now. Over and over, until he can say them in his sleep.\\n\\nAlso, the bar has been set so incredibly low for him I feel confident that he will clear it.']\n",

He will actually have to wait until Biden is finished to respond, and I'm honestly not sure he keep a clear thought in his head that long.\\n\\nBiden just needs to stay focused on the questions he is asked, and when responding to Trump, do so in a straightforward fashion, with no groans or sarcastic remarks. Because simply doing the one thing Trump can't do--which is coming up with intelligent explanations of the issues and ideas for solving problems that aren't drastic, draconian or simpleminded, puts him way ahead of Trump. \\n\\nAnd at least 55% of the American people are as yet not deluded, disillusioned, or cynical enough that they will miss the contrast.\", 'If there are enough informed, critical thinkers who vote in November, President Biden will win reelection!  A good performance in the debate might increase the President’s margin of win!', 'Biden doesn’t need notes or cue cards to deflect Trump’s lies and buffoonery. Everyone seems worried Trump will come out with a bunch of impeccably researched stats and opinions. That surely won’t happen. Joe will keep his cool and stare down the blathering fool as he gets more panicked by the second as he realizes he is going to lose again.', 'What this proves is that many people on the left have bought into the fake videos and lies told daily about Biden by the right wing press and foreign trolls. It accounts for why so many people are dreading this debate. I have zero doubts that Biden will prove everyone wrong and easily win this debate. It is Trump whose supporters need to be worried.

Disgusted with Biden for running and the party letting him - thought he had the humility to see 4 years ago that his job was to also lay the ground for future leadership. \\n\\nI hope he flops, and that the party has to panic and do a convention nomination of Gretchen Whitmer or someone who can invigorate the disgusted voters who will be unmotivated to otherwise vote.', 'As a fearful Democrat, I’m looking to cringe in anticipatory fear/embarrassment like I’m watching Admiral Stockdale in 1992!', 'President Biden has run the country competently for three years, and yet all the focus is on this foolish fear that the media generates:  one slip by Biden and he\\'s \"lost\" the election.  Why isn\\'t felon trump under the spotlight instead?  He has no policies, he rants like a madman, lies like humans breath, and will break all the debate rules within the first two minutes.  Why isn\\'t the media telling Americans to watch for these things, and declaring that a ranting, lying madman is surely not someone to elect as our president?  Why does trump get to be \"trump\" without any consequences, especially since he is an existential threat to our democracy and our country.', 'Biden has enough material to do a 45 minute, uninterrupted, stand up routine. From, “injecting bleach grab em’ by, suckers and losers, I like those who weren’t shot down, the greatest health care plan, nobody is tougher on Russia, I am responsible for overturning Roe”, and on and on.\\n\\nTrump, and any Republican running this year, has nothing to run on. He/they have done nothing and have no plans to do anything. \\n\\nIf Biden tries to go the policy route, Trump will eat his lunch. America doesn’t want to hear a policy debate. I don’t want to hear about policy, I want him to spend the entire evening systematically taking Trump apart using Trump’s own stupid words. \\n\\nEnough of “Democrat Nice”. America is at war. The war has been going on for 30 years and democrats have been trying to ignore the conflict and govern the country.\\n\\nThursday night is a major tipping point for the election and, by extension, America. Biden must win decisively. And he must do it by attacking Trump at every opportunity.']\n",

      "\t Trump is in an environment he can't control. He has no grasp of policy issues. He has no credible policies to offer Americans beyond slogans. He has no audience of supporters to play to for encouragement. His mic will be silenced when not asked to speak. Biden will tout his achievements which are considerable (lowest unemployment in decades, manufacturing jobs at an all time high, the best post Covid economy in the world, prescription drug prices drastically reduced etc.,). Biden will also may hay of Trump's 34 felony convictions involving an adult film actress, while his wife was pregnant, as well as a being convicted of liability for sexual assault by a jury. It will be a tough night for Trump against a savvy pro.\n",

His advisors are urging him not to focus on his accomplishments and instead attack Trump, which is the only advice they can give, because he has no accomplishments. Of course, his whole strategy will be to try to get under Trump's skin, so he will repeat the word \"loser\" at every opportunity.

His advisors are urging him not to focus on his accomplishments and instead attack Trump, which is the only advice they can give, because he has no accomplishments. Of course, his whole strategy will be to try to get under Trump's skin, so he will repeat the word \"loser\" at every opportunity.
